### Angular and Typescript 


### Lessons Learned
1. Clientside, Angular introduced and worked with for about 40 hours. It is wonderful how much Spring Security works with Angular for security on front-end. I have so much more to learn.
1. Angular kept frezing so knowing command line below helped in making the app restart
```ng serve -o --port=4208 &```

and foreground command to Contrl+C to exit the app 
```fg``` 
1. Did I mention this course is now all remote!! Ask questions even if you don't know what to ask don't just pretend like you have an understanding when you don't.

### Timeline
* June 5, 2020 to June 7, 2020 - setup Postman testing Application and User tables
* June 12, 2020 to June 14, 2020 - setup webapps vanillaJS front-end <-this was placed in a static file. I will need to rebuild this whole file after the course is over. VanillaJS is my major weakness and I need to improve significantly->
* June 19, 2020 to June 21, 2020 - setup Angular for client side and app deployment on AWS EC2.

### Development server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4208/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding
Run ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.
