### MySQL schema

### Lessons Learned
1. Database MySQL: Mapping Entities to mySQL two tables, and proper SQL traverse of database that I created.
1. This project was not supposed to have a user table since there is no need to login. During June 12, 2020 through June 14, 2020 refactor code indepently to find way to disable user  which would allow application tracker to disable(DELETE) application without deleting data from database.
   
### Timeline
* June 5, 2020 - June 7, 2020 - setup Postman testing Application and User tables
* June 12, 2020 - June 14, 2020 - setup webapps vanillaJS front-end
