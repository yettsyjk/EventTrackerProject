### Vanilla Javascript


## Lessons Learned
1. VanillaJS, this course spends a few days teaching a new language for front-end. VanillaJS seems very tedius and not as flexible as Java. Creating buttons and inputs should be easier and I can't imagine a company that utilizes it. However, knowing how vanillaJS works is necessary to understand Javascript fundamentals.
1. Clientside, wanting to disable data seems to be a struggle for me as I thought that having the code in controllers made it easier and not understanding how javascript script.js disables the data.
1. Need more info to create DRY code for XMLHttpRequest() for Create, Update, and Delete routes
